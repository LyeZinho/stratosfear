## Game Systems

### Legal System (Tribunal de Estratosfera)
- **Auto-Lawsuit**: Triggered when player aircraft crash from enemy fire
- **Contestation**: Evidence-based defense with odds calculation
- **Influence Lobbying**: Buy political favor (2000 credits/point, max 20)
- **Outcomes**: Payment, Legal Victory, Legal Defeat, or War Declaration

### Stock Market
- Faction prices volatilize based on military losses and legal outcomes
- Lawsuit victories: -10% (plaintiff loses confidence)
- Lawsuit defeats: +15% (plaintiff gains confidence)
- Historical tick data maintained (last 100 ticks)

### Incident Reporting
- Crash location, terrain type, pilot status
- Financial impact calculation
- Automatic lawsuit creation for enemy-caused crashes
