## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Port 9347 already in use"
```bash
# Find what's using it
lsof -i :9347

# Use different port
PORT=9348 npm run preview
```

### "Docker container exits immediately"
```bash
docker-compose logs stratosfear
# See error message and check DEPLOYMENT.md
```

### "Slow performance in Docker"
```bash
# Increase Docker memory
docker update --memory=4g stratosfear
```

### "Game won't load"
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Verify port is accessible: `curl http://localhost:9347`
3. Check firewall/antivirus blocking
